# MODLOG — Thrust/Zarch experimental (helicopter build)

Own browser game (Three.js r170), no third-party game files. Route: direct source changes (we own the code).
Oracle: tools/snap.mjs headless Chrome (SwiftShader) driving the real game with keyboard + debug bridge
(`?debug&kb&peace`, `window.__G`). Scenes in tools/scenes/: smoke, heli, loop, rescue, perf (+ damage, cockpit).

## 2026-10-10 — damage model + fuel + cockpit
Plan (one commit per stage, each verified with a scene + screenshots):
1. Fuel: burn 2.2 → 0.9 %/s at full collective (hover ≈ 3.5 min), emergency fuel drop 25 → 50 %.
2. Damage model (game/js/damage.js): components with health (main rotor, tail rotor, engine, transmission,
   hydraulics, fuel tank, avionics, skids). Hits from enemy fire / rams / hard landings / tail strikes damage
   parts instead of instant death. Failure effects feed the flight model:
   - tail rotor lost → no anti-torque → torque-reaction spin; cure: lower collective, fly fast (fin), or cut the
     engine and autorotate (no engine torque, no spin);
   - engine damage → power loss / rpm droop; engine fire burns it out (extinguisher puts it out);
   - transmission chip → seizes when critical → rotor rpm decays;
   - hydraulics → heavy, slow controls, no SAS; fuel tank → leak; avionics → gauges fail; skids → softer limits;
   - main rotor destroyed → no lift → fall.
   Repairs: home pad / home intake pad = full repair; field repair via logistics call (L) when landed safely.
3. Cockpit: second gauge row (fuel, eng temp, xmsn, hyd, torque, N1/N2), caution/warning annunciator panel,
   clickable switches (engine, SAS, hyd boost, fire extinguisher, landing light) + keyboard shortcuts.

### Stage 2 notes (damage model) — verified with tools/scenes/damage.json (11 checks, 3/3 runs green)
- Tail rotor lost at hover → ~1.3 rad/s yaw after 2.5 s (death spin). Cutting the engine (I) removes main-rotor
  torque: spin falls to <0.5 rad/s; autorotation + flare lands intact; L → field repair (tail ≥ 60%) + 50% fuel;
  engine back on, lift-off without spin.
- Gotcha 1: touchdown only checked ground under the centre → on slopes the tail and then a blade struck the uphill
  side (ROTOR STRIKE death). Fix: contact = highest ground under the four skid ends.
- Gotcha 2: lifting off a slope scraped the tail → "tail strike". Now only counts with >2 m/s or >8.6° nose-up,
  and 25 cm below ground.
- Gotcha 3: cave "hard landing" branch accepted side-on wall hits at 25 cells/s; now needs |vx| < 6.
- Scripted autopilots must flare like a pilot (target sink = 0.45·AGL); a fixed collective can't autorotate.
