# MODLOG — Thrust/Zarch experimental (helicopter build)

Own browser game (Three.js r170), no third-party game files. Route: direct source changes (we own the code).
Oracle: tools/snap.mjs headless Chrome (SwiftShader) driving the real game with keyboard + debug bridge
(`?debug&kb&peace`, `window.__G`). Scenes in tools/scenes/: smoke, heli, loop, rescue, perf (+ damage, cockpit).

## 2026-10-10 — damage model + fuel + cockpit
Plan (one commit per stage, each verified with a scene + screenshots):
1. Fuel: burn 2.2 → 0.9 %/s at full collective (hover ≈ 3.5 min), emergency fuel drop 25 → 50 %.
2. Damage model (game/js/damage.js): components with health (main rotor, tail rotor, engine, transmission,
   hydraulics, fuel tank, avionics, skids). Hits from enemy fire / rams / hard landings / tail strikes damage
   parts instead of instant death. Failure effects feed the flight model:
   - tail rotor lost → no anti-torque → torque-reaction spin; cure: lower collective, fly fast (fin), or cut the
     engine and autorotate (no engine torque, no spin);
   - engine damage → power loss / rpm droop; engine fire burns it out (extinguisher puts it out);
   - transmission chip → seizes when critical → rotor rpm decays;
   - hydraulics → heavy, slow controls, no SAS; fuel tank → leak; avionics → gauges fail; skids → softer limits;
   - main rotor destroyed → no lift → fall.
   Repairs: home pad / home intake pad = full repair; field repair via logistics call (L) when landed safely.
3. Cockpit: second gauge row (fuel, eng temp, xmsn, hyd, torque, N1/N2), caution/warning annunciator panel,
   clickable switches (engine, SAS, hyd boost, fire extinguisher, landing light) + keyboard shortcuts.
